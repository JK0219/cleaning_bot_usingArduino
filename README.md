# 🧹 Cleaning Bot

A smart, Arduino-powered cleaning robot that follows user-defined paths or navigates autonomously using obstacle avoidance. Built with simple yet powerful components like HC-05 Bluetooth, L298N motor driver, and ultrasonic sensors, Cleaning Bot is a flexible, efficient solution for modern households and small businesses.

## How It Works

- **Manual Mode**: Control the bot using F (forward), B (backward), L (left), R (right), 0 (stop), and X (reverse path).
- **Automatic Mode**: Entered using 'T'. The bot automatically detects and avoids obstacles using the ultrasonic sensor.
- **Reverse Navigation**: After path completion, press 'X' to retrace steps back to the start.

## Code Overview

The Arduino sketch uses:
- `Serial.read()` to receive Bluetooth commands
- Motor control logic with `digitalWrite()`
- Path storage and reversal logic using a `char[]`
- Obstacle avoidance with ultrasonic distance measurements

## How to Use

1. Upload the sketch to Arduino UNO.
2. Power the bot and pair the HC-05 module via your phone.
3. Use a Bluetooth terminal app to send commands:
   - `F` – Forward
   - `B` – Backward
   - `L` – Left
   - `R` – Right
   - `0` – Stop
   - `X` – Retrace path
   - `T` – Start automatic obstacle mode
   - `S` – Exit automatic mode
